Progress sofar:

Tasks completed:

1. Implement a new masonry grid layout -> DONE
2. Implement lazy loading of cards when a user is scrolling -> DONE

Additionally:
Broken image directive added for missing images.

Things to note:

1. Some images are missing on the server
2. Image sizes are way larger then required, loading time could be further optimized by reducing the size of image (e.g making thumbnails)

Code requires refactoring and further optimization, which I will do at the end when we met all the functionality required.
