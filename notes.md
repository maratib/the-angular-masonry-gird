Thanks indeed it helped, I have updated the demo with ImageServer optimization. you can do hard refresh on the same url.

I cant wait to add this component to homes-web repo to see it live.
But I feel it is the fastest and cleaner way to develop it outside of the project and bring the refined component to the big picture once it is finalized.
Hope you will bear my approach for the time being. Apart of that let me know if I am doing good?

Progress sofar:

Tasks completed:

1. Implement a new masonry grid layout -> DONE
2. Implement lazy loading of cards when a user is scrolling -> DONE

Additionally:

1. Broken image directive added for missing images.

Things to note:

1. Some images are missing on the server
2. Image sizes are way larger then required, loading time could be further optimized by reducing the size of image (e.g making thumbnails)

Current working demo : https://maratib.github.io/the-angular-masonry-gird/

Current Source code: https://github.com/maratib/the-angular-masonry-gird

Note: Code is not finalized in anyway, it is still under development (requires refactoring and further optimization), which I will do at the end when we met all the functionality required. Suggestions/comments will be appreciated.
